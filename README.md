# workspace configuration

# why?
there are a whole host of tools to setup workstations but none are simple,
this is an attempt at simple.

# installation
run the provided `install.sh` and enjoy.

To load iTerm preferences, point to this directory under `iTerm2` >
`Preferences` > `Load preferences from a custom folder or URL`.

# assumptions
- install everything with brew
- ruby version will be `2.3.4`
- neovim is the only vim
- the less in the vim config, the better
- we remote pair with [ngrok+tmux](./REMOTE_PAIRING.md) or Screenhero
